```

### 3.1. Actions
Here we have the _endpoints_ which allow us to perform some actions in the blog, like: 

* List posts paginated
* Get a single post
* Delete a post
* Create a new post

### 3.2. Domain
In this directory we can found the two modules that the application is composed. Each module has exactly 3 folders:

* **Application:** Contains all the use cases
* **Domain:** Contains all the the interfaces needed to allow the talk between application and infrastructure
* **Infrastructure:** Contains all the concrete implementations of the domain contracts

Here we can als found two more directories:

* **Entities:** Where we store our _models_
* **Shared:** Where we store interfaces and classes of shared use, like exceptions or checkers.

### 3.3. Responder
Last but not least important, in the responder folder we can found all the classes that handle the responses.

## 4. Extend the project
If you want to play with the code and add your self actions, it's very easy! Take for example the case you want
add an **edit author** action:

You just need to:

1. Create your action (in the `Action\Author` folder)
2. Create your use case (in the `Domain\Module\Author\Application\EditAuthor`)
3. Think if you need an _ad-hoc_ responder or you can use an existent (for this case, the `ResourceResponder` will do the job)
4. Register the route for your action in `config/routes/author.yml`

That's all!
